Before starting to use WG Tunnel, it is important to understand that WG Tunnel
is not a VPN provider. 

The app does not provide pre-installed server configurations. 
Similar to the official WireGuard Android app, it is expected that the user already 
has WireGuard configs to import (either from self-hosting or from a VPN provider 
that allows for the exporting configs to third-party apps).
