# Privacy Policy
*Effective as of April 13, 2025*

WG Tunnel provides an alternative Android client app for network tunnels using the WireGuard Protocol. WG Tunnel is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the app handles your data.

## Information You Provide
WG Tunnel does not collect, store, or transmit personal data, such as user inputs, VPN connection details, or device identifiers. No data is shared with WG Tunnel or any third parties, as the app does not use third-party analytics, advertising, or other services.

## Optional Local Logging
You may choose to enable local logging within the app. If enabled, logs related to the app’s operation (e.g., connection status) are written locally to your device. These logs are not transmitted or stored anywhere except your local device. You can disable logging at any time to prevent local log creation.

## Background Location
When the auto-tunnel feature is enabled, the app reads your Wi-Fi SSID name in the background to determine whether to activate the VPN. This information is not stored, transmitted, or used for any other purpose. You can disable the auto-tunnel feature in the app settings to prevent background location access.

## Data Security
WG Tunnel uses WireGuard’s secure encryption protocols to protect your VPN connections, ensuring your network activity remains private.

## Permissions
The app requires network access to establish VPN connections and, if you enable the auto-tunnel feature, background location access to read Wi-Fi SSID names.

## Updates to This Policy
This Privacy Policy will be kept up-to-date. Significant changes will be communicated via email or app update notes. Your continued use of WG Tunnel after such updates confirms your acceptance of the revised policy.

## Contact
If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact [support@wgtunnel.com](mailto:support@wgtunnel.com). Expect a response within 5 business days.
