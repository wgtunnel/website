# F-Droid Removal

In light of recent actions taken by F-Droid, I have decided to remove WG Tunnel from their platform.

## Explanation

A few months ago, it came to my attention that F-Droid has been receiving substantial funding from the [Open Technology Fund (OTF)](https://www.opentech.fund/), which is supported by the U.S. government. While this wasn't an immediate dealbreaker, I have reservations about a platform that presents itself as primarily driven by community donations and volunteers, yet accepts large sums of money from government sources. This funding ultimately comes from taxpayer money collected coercively, and I have ethical concerns about F-Droid's taking such funds.

More recently, I learned that F-Droid has initiated a [campaign against religious texts](https://x.com/LundukeJournal/status/1979929701423477156) on their platform, including the Bible and the Quran. These apps have been marked as NSFW (Not Safe for Work), with all Bible apps specifically tagged as promoting "porn and violence content." There are also ongoing discussions about potentially removing all NSFW-tagged apps from the store entirely. The NSFW tag alone effectively shadow bans these apps, hiding them behind a filter by default.

As a Christian, I can no longer in good conscience keep my app in their store.

For now, WG Tunnel will remain available via Google Play and as a standalone version on GitHub. I recommend tools like [Obtainium](https://obtainium.imranr.dev/) for an app store-like experience with the standalone version.

If you still wish to manage the app from F-Droid repository supporting store clients, you can add [WG Tunnel's F-Droid repository](https://github.com/wgtunnel/fdroid) to these apps.

Thank you for your understanding in this matter.

Zane
