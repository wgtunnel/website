# FAQ

This section addresses commonly asked questions about WG Tunnel.

## Is WG Tunnel supported on Android TV?

Yes, WG Tunnel is supported on Android TV.

Amazon Fire TV is not officially supported, but the app works when sideloaded.

## Does WG Tunnel work with Android Auto?

Yes, WG Tunnel is compatible with Android Auto by leveraging the [split tunneling](tunnels#split-tunneling) feature.

To enable compatibility, use [split tunneling](tunnels#split-tunneling) to exclude the Android Auto app package from the tunnel.

## Why are some features unavailable on Android TV?

Android TV lacks certain capabilities and security features available on mobile Android devices.

As a result, some WG Tunnel features are disabled on Android TV to ensure compatibility.

## Why does WG Tunnel require location permissions for auto-tunneling?

Android classifies Wi-Fi SSIDs as precise location information. For WG Tunnel to read the Wi-Fi name (SSID) for auto-tunneling, it requires location permission and location services enabled.

To circumvent this, WG Tunnel supports alternative [Wi-Fi detection methods](auto-tunneling#wi-fi-detection-method) like [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/).

## How do I exclude my local network from the tunnel to access local services and devices?

When editing a tunnelâ€™s configuration, you can use the *Exclude LAN* action button for each peer. This automatically excludes all private IP address blocks from the tunnel by adding only public IP address blocks to the `AllowedIPs` configuration.

> **Tip**: For more precise IP exclusions, use the [AllowedIPs Calculator](https://www.procustodibus.com/blog/2021/03/wireguard-allowedips-calculator/) to generate a custom `AllowedIPs` list.

## Can I switch tunnels based on which app is open?

This is technically possible via automation apps like [Tasker](https://tasker.joaoapps.com/), but it is not yet built into WG Tunnel. It is planned for future versions.

## Will WG Tunnel ever support other platforms, like desktop?

A long-term goal is to create a desktop app, but this would take an immense amount of effort. This project only has a single developer and no funding for such an endeavor.
