# Getting Started

Before starting to use WG Tunnel, it is important to understand that WG Tunnel
is not a VPN provider.

The app does not provide pre-installed server configurations.
Similar to the official WireGuard Android app, it is expected that the user already
has WireGuard configs to import (either from self-hosting or from a VPN provider
that allows for the exporting configs to third-party apps).
